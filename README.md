This repository is a container for Paul Mann's lrstar & dfa parser
generator system.  The most notable thing about Paul's system is that
it works with EBNF grammers and generates the smallest and fastest
parsers with automatic AST generation.

The main thrust of this repository is to port the original Windows
code to compile & run on standard Linux systems, and to provide
comprehensive documentation so that everyone can learn about this
great parser generator.

Paul's website is:

And his version of the code can be downloaded from here:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/lrstar/

Paul has been working on this technology for, literally, decades.  It
has been used in commercial software, and if you find this parser
generator useful, why don't you drop a line or some cash to Paul at
his website.  This would be especially nice if you are using his tools
in a business setting.

Paul has given his approval for this repository and the changes to
make it build & run well on Linux.
